# Description: A smooth, slick, completely modular GTK theme.
# 100% free and open source.

# NOTE: Uncommenting means to delete the "#" at the beginning of a line.
# Commenting means to add a "#" at the beginning of a line. The "#" tells the
# theme to ignore everything after it on that line. This is the primary method
# of customization: turning each module off/on via commenting/uncommenting.

# PRIMARY CUSTOMIZATIONS
# If you look into these modules, you'll find that they take advantage of
# the fact that if there are multiple styles with the same name, they get
# merged together. The merged style is then used in the matching phase.
